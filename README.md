### About me

I currently do Android native development for a financial institution. 

I love spending my free time with my wife Jessica and son Dean.

### What I use Github for

I have some public projects of app ideas and learning apps.

A lot of my projects are private because they are codelabs, or used just for trying something new out.

Github makes it easy for me to get to my projects from any of the way too many computers I have.

### What Else

## Iâ€™m currently working on...

My own side apps as well as just latching onto whatever new things and Codelabs come out.

## Iâ€™m currently learning...

To be a better developer, mostly though continuous development using Android and Kotlin as there is always room to improve. 
I also learn whatever I need to solve problems and come up with different solutions for my personal projects.
