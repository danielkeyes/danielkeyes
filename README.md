### About me

I currently do Android native development for a financial institution.

### What I use Github for

I recently moved to Github as my version control of choice for my learning/side projects. Most my projects I keep private and only share with those who I collaborate with or solicit feedback from. I do have some public projects.

### What Else

## Iâ€™m currently working on...

My own side apps as well as just latching onto whatever new things and Codelabs come out.

## Iâ€™m currently learning...

To be a better developer, mostly though continuous development using Android and Kotlin as there is always room to improve. 
I also learn whatever I need to solve problems and come up with different solutions for my personal projects.
